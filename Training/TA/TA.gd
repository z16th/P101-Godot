# Training A: From lessons 01 to 09

# Let's simulate the process of buying at a convenience store

# 1. Create a dictionary called store_inventory that contains at least five item_name:quantity
# 2. Create a dictionary called store_prices that contains the same item names from #1 but use item_name:price
# 3. Create an empty array called client_shopping_bag
# 4. Add 3 item names to the client_shopping_bag
# 5. Create a function called checkout that calculates the total based on the items inside the client_shopping_bag
# 6. Create a function called print_receipt that prints statements using the next format:
#	"{item name} : {item price}"
#	"{item name} : {item price}"
#	"{item name} : {item price}"
#	"Total : {total price}"
